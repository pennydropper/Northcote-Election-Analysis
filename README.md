# Northcote-Election-Analysis
Code and data for my Northcote Election Analysis

Having lived in Northcote for nearly 30 years and having voted in 8 state elections (including a by-election) and 9 federal elections, it occurred to me that there were many unanswered questions about my electorate and neighbourhood.

Background
My neighbourhood has a strong working class history. The Australian Labor Party (ALP) has held the Federal Division of Cooper (formerly Batman) for all but 10 years since Federation in 1901. Similarly, the ALP has held the State District of Northcote for all but 1 year since its creation in 1927. Federal representatives include an ALP Deputy Prime Minister and State representatives include an ALP Premier.

Trending from ALP to Greens
The demographics of Northcote has swung from the traditional blue collar ALP-supporter to the more progressive, typically educated Greens' supporter. The trend was sufficiently strong for the Australian Greens to snatch the District of Northcote away from the ALP in a by-election in 2017. The ALP regained the seat in the statewide election in 2018 despite the Australian Greens increasing their first-preference votes compared to their support in the 2017 by-election.

Curiosity-driven Analysis
This analysis started with some basic questions, which, when answered, led to more questions:

Which polling stations in Northcote most supported the Australian Greens?
Where are the different polling stations?
How many people tend to vote at the different stations?
How many enrolled voters failed to vote in the 2017 by-election?
How have Liberal voters divided their preferences between the ALP and the Greens over time? The Liberal party chose not to field a candidate in the 2017 by-election, which the media assumed was an attempt to make mischief for the governing ALP.
